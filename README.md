# Comments: All faculty advisors are initialized as "Foo Bar", even when adding a new student, but they can be updated. State input is validated using a method that references a table called "States" that has one column "StateName" with all state names (full name) in alphabetical order. I also changed the name of the students.csv file to studentdata.csv. 
# Some logic was implemented using stack overflow and ChatGPT as references
